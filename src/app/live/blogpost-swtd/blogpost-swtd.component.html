                      <p>...to the desert in southwest Texas was to spend  
                        a weekend with another couple in a cabin overlooking the Pecos river. The cabin we 
                        stayed in was on land once owned by the Rock Art Foundation but now owned by the 
                        Witte Museum of San Antonio (you can read about it <a href="https://www.wittemuseum.org/rock-art/">here.</a>
                        <br />
                          <br /> The couple we were staying with, Dave and Patty, had access to the cabin because Dave 
                          was one of the guides to the pictograph sites on the land. The cabin was extremely 
                          rustic, with no electricity or running water and since this trip occurred in a time before 
                          smart phones, we spent the evenings talking to each other. During one of our 
                          conversations I remember telling Dave that even though that part of the country is 
                          impressive, I just wasn't comfortable there. He asked why, and after a short pause I told 
                          him that everything about the area felt dangerous to me.

                        "I couldn't believe Texas was real. When I arrived there, there wasn't a blade of green grass or a leaf to be seen, but I was absolutely crazy about it. There wasn't a tree six inches in diameter at the time. For me Texas is the same big wonderful thing that the oceans and the highest mountains are."

                          <h3>In truth, the desert near where the Pecos and Rio Grande rivers converge is dangerous.</h3>
                          <p>
                                It's dry scrubland covered with prickly pear cactus, tasajillo, yucca, and Agave 
                                lechuguilla...all species of vegetation evolved to poke you with spiny leaves or thorns if 
                                you get too close. And the creatures that populate the area aren't much 
                                different...scorpions, centipedes, snakes and red ants prevail. It's a very sparsely populated area. 
                                From Comstock to Sanderson is 88 miles of of scrubland with only small towns like Langtry (pop. 12) and Dryden (pop. 33) 
                                and the occasional scattered ranch house (some occupied, but most abandoned) to break up the monotony of the road. 
                                A break-down on this road, where there is often no cell phone service and little traffic could mean hours of 
                                sitting and waiting for a Highway Patrol cruiser to happen by.  It truly feels desolate.

                      <p> Sometimes, the silence is so complete 
                            you can feel your mind and body relax like you've been unplugged. And the night sky 
                            is so dark you can see a multitude of stars with a clarity not seen in most parts of 
                            the country. Dave told me that he knew of a few people who had sold their homes in the
                            city and bought ranches in the area to try to permanently get that feeling of serenity. But
                            after a while, most of them began to go a little crazy from the loneliness and isolation and
                            ran back to the noise and chaos of civilization.
                            
                      </p>
                         <br /> 
                      <p> We've been back to the desert many times since that trip. We usually stay at Seminole 
                            Canyon State Park, about 10 miles west of Comstock. Sometimes we stay for just a weekend and 
                            sometimes we stay for a few weeks. For us, it’s like recharging out “inner-peace” batteries, 
                            and it can be an almost spiritual experience…but I wouldn’t want to live there.
